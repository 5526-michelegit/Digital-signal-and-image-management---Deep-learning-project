# CMU Arctic - Audio Classification & Labelled Faces in the Wild - GAN Project

This project leverages deep learning to tackle two distinct challenges: audio classification within the CMU Arctic dataset and image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) focused on the Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset.

## Project Overview

### Audio Classification
The audio classification segment aimed at analyzing, preprocessing, and extracting features from audio files to accurately classify them using deep learning models. Key steps included data exploration to understand audio file properties, standardization, feature extraction, and model development. Our efforts culminated in a deep learning model achieving an accuracy of 99.12%, with precision and recall both above 99%.

### Image Generation with GANs
The image generation portion explored data image processing through face detection and cropping to preprocess the Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset. We experimented with two types of GAN models to generate new, realistic faces. The project delved into preprocessing techniques, model development, and evaluation, aiming to enhance the quality and realism of generated images.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python for scripting
- Libraries: Scipy, wave for audio analysis; Keras and TensorFlow for model development
- Kaggle and CSV for data handling and preprocessing
